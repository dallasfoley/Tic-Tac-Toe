# React Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe built with React. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## How to Play
The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.<br />
Players take turns clicking on a square to place their X or O mark.<br />
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.<br />
If all nine squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is declared a tie.<br />
You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Reset" button.<br />

### Board: Manages the game state and renders the 3x3 game board.
